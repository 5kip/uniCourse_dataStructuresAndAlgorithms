**What's a compiler?**

Read [this blogpost](https://www.scaler.com/topics/c/compilation-process-in-c/), it has pretty good wording in my opinion.

- Preprocessor (#include, #define)
- Object files
- Linking

**Practical tool understanding**

- Installing a compiler manually (zig C++)
- Compiling manually

**IDE usage**

- Installing like visual studio (but use anything you want, I don't care)
- Using a debugger
