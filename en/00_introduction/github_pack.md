# How to get free stuff from GitHub

If you've got a university email, you can get free stuff by applying for
[GitHub Students Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

Note that the email you get from university is a Microsoft email, and to access it you need to go to
[e.g. office.com](https://www.office.com/), provide your credentials, 
and then select [the outlook app](https://outlook.office.com/mail/).
You'll see your new emails here.
It also comes with the office applications which you can install.

Beside the university email, you need a confirmation that you actually are a student.
You can get that in the management office at university (decanat).
Just enter there and ask for a document that confirms you are a student.
Take a picture of it, you'll need it later for your application.

You will also need a github account, which you can create by 
[this link](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home).
You may use any email to sign up, you will be able to attach your university email to your account after signing up.

If you have an account already, or you've just created one and haven't attached your univesity email to it yet,
you can do it by using the UI on [this page](https://github.com/settings/emails).
After you type in the email, you'll have to confirm it.

Once you have the confirmation document, you can apply online via
[this link](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application).

After some time, maybe a few days, you should get a confirmation letter from GitHub, 
with which you'll get access to all services they give away, like a Rider license or access to GitHub Copilot.

While you're still a student, you can refresh this thing every year, regaining access to all of the goodies.
