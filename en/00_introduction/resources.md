# Resources

I have a lot of example university projects on my github which can be used as reference when doing them youself. 
Most of them are here listed in the `uni_` projects [here](https://github.com/AntonC9018?tab=projects&type=classic).
Almost all of the projects, except [FP](https://github.com/AntonC9018/FP) and [graphs](https://github.com/AntonC9018/graphs)
have `uni_` in their name, so that they are easily found by searching repositories with `uni_` in the name in my github.

Here's my google meet link: [https://meet.google.com/trr-gkmj-cxz](https://meet.google.com/trr-gkmj-cxz).

Here's my google drive link, which contains rendered completed university assignments,
and example test answers, grouped by semester, as well as some books I read when learning:

**Good YouTube videos and channels for learning programming:**

- [Casey Muratori at Molly Rocket](https://www.youtube.com/@MollyRocket).
  This is just a very smart guy who has an immense experience in the industry. You should watch all his lectures.

- [Code Aesthetic](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeAesthetic), 
  who has awesome visual videos for understanding intermediate-advanced programming concepts.

- [Simon Dev's video on floating point numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo89kOv9pVk). 
  I probably won't be covering this in the course, so you may want to learn it on your own.

- [Essense of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab).
  This topic is very important to understand for game development and graphics, and it's best understood visually in my opinion.
  There's no better source for learning this than these series.

- [Essense of Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr).
  This is to understand derivatives and integrals, which are occasionally useful in game development.

- [Associativity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq71Ev9-aQE). 
  You really want to understand this if you study abstract algebra.
  It will really help you big time in realizing what's going on in the lectures.
  Probably not relevant for this course though.

- [OOP is bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM1iUe6IofM). This video explains why.


**Some articles:**

- [Zig compiler](https://ziglang.org/), which I'll use to compile C and C++ (it bundles Clang).

- [Virtual multiple inheritance in C++](https://www.cnblogs.com/yetanghanCpp/p/9288708.html). 
  I will cover this in a future lesson and move the link, but for now, I'll keep it here.


**Precausions:**

- Don't EVER under any circumstances use pirated software, like [monkrus'](https://w14.monkrus.ws/).
  ALWAYS install the official bloated Windows 10 version from the official site and 
  ALWAYS be sure to install office tools from official installation files 
  (you get the license from the university too!), which come with telemetry to make the services better.
